<meetreks> let me try ruby
(06:32:55 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> you might have to guide me
(06:33:23 PM) sacarlson: sure I would love to know if my code runs on windows since at some point I do plan to port it
(06:34:10 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> OK
(06:34:14 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I am in ruby
(06:34:16 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> what next
(06:34:46 PM) sacarlson: then you will want to download my git
(06:35:11 PM) sacarlson: https://github.com/sacarlson/pokerth_accounting
(06:35:25 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> like npm install and the link?
(06:35:31 PM) sacarlson: there is a download botton https://github.com/sacarlson/pokerth_accounting/archive/master.zip
(06:36:23 PM) sacarlson: after you have the files uncompressed in a directory you will need to install some gem stuf
(06:36:39 PM) sacarlson: that's the part I'm unsure of in windows
(06:36:39 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I have gems already
(06:36:43 PM) sacarlson: oh ok
(06:37:18 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> how do I run?
(06:37:47 PM) sacarlson: so how would you get sqlite3 ruby-sqlite3  support?
(06:38:14 PM) sacarlson: on linux we just sudo apt-get install ruby-full sqlite3 ruby-sqlite3
(06:39:15 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I have everything sacarlson
(06:39:29 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I now have your files uncompressed
(06:39:31 PM) sacarlson: oh then gem install rest-client
(06:39:48 PM) sacarlson: gem install json
(06:39:58 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I have Json
(06:40:12 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I have rest-client as well
(06:40:17 PM) sacarlson: ok
(06:40:28 PM) sacarlson: so we need to create some accounts
(06:40:51 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> right
(06:40:55 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> how do we do that?
(06:41:07 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> use Stellar BOT itself
(06:41:40 PM) sacarlson: well I guess if all the parts are installed you could just cd to the directory and run pokerth_accounting.rb
(06:41:49 PM) sacarlson: that would auto create an account
(06:42:13 PM) sacarlson: my software in theory would also fund the account for you
(06:42:23 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> ok
(06:42:26 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> let me try
(06:42:37 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> just for saftey i tried json
(06:42:41 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> it is taking a while
(06:43:25 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> ok done
(06:43:27 PM) sacarlson: you will also want a sqlite browser  do they have one on windows?
(06:43:36 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Yes :)
(06:44:23 PM) sacarlson: well I don't see account number sent to http://poker.surething.biz/  so something didn't work
(06:45:09 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Well
(06:45:11 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I ran it
(06:45:27 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> it asked me to open  your rb fil
(06:45:27 PM) sacarlson: so any output on the console?
(06:45:30 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> i chose IE
(06:45:38 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> and i just gives me the full source code
(06:45:42 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> nope
(06:45:48 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> nothing on th console
(06:46:53 PM) sacarlson: I would assume in a console you would type ruby ./pokerth_accounting.rb  to get the interpreter to run it
(06:47:16 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> in windows
(06:47:29 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> it is ruby pokerth_accounting.rb
(06:47:32 PM) sacarlson: in your command window
(06:48:15 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> yes
(06:48:24 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> now getting proper error
(06:48:32 PM) sacarlson: you should see errors output if you don't have the gems installed
(06:48:44 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I have gems
(06:48:49 PM) sacarlson: errors being what?
(06:49:40 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> 'require' cannot load such file  -- sys/proctable <Loaderror >
(06:49:52 PM) sacarlson: gem install rest-client
(06:49:58 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I did
(06:50:24 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> and it sucessfully installed
(06:50:28 PM) sacarlson: ok we can comment out the sys/proctable we won't need it for what you want
(06:50:59 PM) sacarlson: oh maybe we can install that too?
(06:51:27 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> how
(06:51:32 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> gem install ??
(06:51:32 PM) sacarlson: gem install sys-proctable
(06:52:30 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> ok got it
(06:52:35 PM) sacarlson: ok
(06:52:52 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> now
(06:53:10 PM) sacarlson: ruby ./pokerth_accounting.rb  and see what other error we see
(06:53:13 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> modir: no such file or directory
(06:53:44 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> C:/userrs/user2/ ...
(06:53:49 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> ENOENT
(06:54:44 PM) sacarlson: oh these paths won't work in windows ~/.pokerth/log-files/
(06:55:11 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> so what whould I remove?
(06:55:16 PM) sacarlson: so I would have to change them to something windows would use
(06:55:54 PM) sacarlson: what was this C:/userrs/user2/ ?
(06:56:03 PM) sacarlson: was that in the error ?
(06:56:08 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Yes
(06:56:10 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Guess
(06:56:21 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> it is trying to log it in windows defautl
(06:56:54 PM) sacarlson: so do those dir exist?
(06:57:33 PM) sacarlson: I guess at this point you will have to pick a directory maybe a subdir of where you uncompressed it
(06:58:42 PM) sacarlson: that you would have to create then modify the lines 12 and 13 to point at them
(07:00:41 PM) sacarlson: another option is run everything on linux mint in a virtualbox running on your windows
(07:01:12 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> guess gem install sqllite3
(07:01:18 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I changed the logs path
(07:01:25 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> now I get SQL exception  :)
(07:01:40 PM) sacarlson: what line is that pointing at?
(07:02:05 PM) sacarlson: you did install sqlite3?
(07:03:00 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> just giving this now...to be usre
(07:03:06 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> gem install sqlite3
(07:03:17 PM) sacarlson: yes you will need that
(07:03:23 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> very quickly it has done that
(07:03:25 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> again
(07:03:51 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> OK
(07:03:55 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> I get these things
(07:04:14 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> last log filename = accountlog.pdb
(07:04:22 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> got here not exist
(07:04:39 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Exception occured in configs
(07:04:50 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> no such table : Player
(07:05:27 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Guess it is an SQL exception
(07:05:31 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> looking for table Player
(07:05:36 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> but cant find the schema
(07:07:00 PM) sacarlson: if it didn't exist it was supposed to create it
(07:07:12 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Hmm
(07:07:39 PM) sacarlson: oh at this point it is looking for log files generated by pokerth
(07:08:13 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> Yes
(07:08:22 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> any suggestions
(07:08:45 PM) sacarlson: well for the full package you could install pokerth  there is a windows version but..
(07:09:25 PM) sacarlson: you just want the tools so maybe they will already work
(07:09:57 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> OK
(07:10:02 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> send me that
(07:10:20 PM) sacarlson: try run ruby check_account.rb
(07:10:30 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> ok
(07:10:38 PM) sacarlson: I think we won't need it for what you want 
(07:10:53 PM) sacarlson: we will just use the payment class at this point
(07:11:10 PM) stellar-slack: <meetreks> That is running fine
(07:11:17 PM) sacarlson: cool
